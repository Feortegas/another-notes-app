# Another Notes App

## Description
Note taker app, that allows the user to create new notes directly on their browser, with a title and description fields.

## Usage
Go back to simpler times, when notes where just notes and not "smart" notes.
Keep track of your thoughts and to-dos and even maybe that secret grandma Christimas cookies recipe.
The Notes app will allow you to Create new Notes and Edit them. Title and Description are the only fields available.
